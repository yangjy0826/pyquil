# Pyquil
The jupyter notebooks of running quantum algorithms by [pyQuil](https://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
## 1 [Pyquil Installation and the Bell State](https://github.com/yangjy0826/pyquil/blob/master/Pyquil%20Installation%20and%20the%20Bell%20State.ipynb)
The installation process of Pyquil, QVM and its compiler on Ubuntu. 
## 2 [Implementation of HHL algorithm to solve a 2 by 2 linear system](https://github.com/yangjy0826/pyquil/blob/master/Pyquil_HHL_2by2.ipynb)
This implementation is exactly the same one with [that on QISKit](https://github.com/yangjy0826/IBM-QISKit/blob/master/qiskit_HHL_2by2.ipynb), thus I did not include a detailed information here. For more explanation, please go to that file.
